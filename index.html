      <p><span style='font-size: 110%'>Hello,</span> welcome to my repository of in-game books of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. In my free time I have transcribed books from the video game and have made them available for download to everyone on this website.</p>
      <p><em>"Hasn't this been done yet? Every single book is listed and fully transcribed on the <a href='https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Books_(Skyrim)#Available_books' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>fan wiki</a>."</em></p>
      <p>Well, yes, but no. I have not just written down the contents by hand, but I have also formatted them to look good on individual pages and have converted them into docx then pdf files, so you can print them and read them as real books. I'm also planning on making Kindle versions, which then you can read wherever without the need for a big, bulky bag to hold all that paper. That is, once I get my hands on the tools required to make this possible.</p>

    Sample Text
    The Thieves Guild of Skyrim is something of an enigma. Within the last few decades, their order has gone from one of the largest, most influential criminal organizations in all of Tamriel to a small group of stragglers barely able to wreak havoc in their home city of Riften. Although evidence that could explain this rapid decline has never surfaced, speculation has run rampant.
